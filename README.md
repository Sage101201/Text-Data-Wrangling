This repo contains my attempt at Wrangling textual data stored in a custom .csv file as part of my assignment in FIT5196 - Data Wrangling unit at Monash University. 

Some of main concepts explored are tokenisation, stemming, removal of stopwords, creation of vocabulary, PMI (Pointwise Mutual Information) measure etc.

The main goal of this task was to extract unigrams and bigrams from the textual data (comments part) and create a vocabulary to search and locate different contexts/words used.
